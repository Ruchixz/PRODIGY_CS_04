A simple keylogger program with C++
Built with C++, a keylogger notes all the keys pressed while the program is executed. This can be used with malicious intentions, for identity theft etc., but my program is only built with the intention of knowledge and exploring cybersecurity. This is a task assign by Prodigy Infotech, and hence I completed it.
